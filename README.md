# Traffic-Volume-Estimate

With the help of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in the MATLAB environment, an artificial neural network model was created and 6000 of the data obtained from 14 different factors were used to train the artificial neural network using the Time Series method and the results close to the actual data were obtained in the next 48 hours of traffic density forecast.
